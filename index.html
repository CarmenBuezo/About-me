      <h1 class="sectionHeader">About Me</h1>
      <p class="sectionP">I am an enthusiastic, all-around, charismatic individual who likes to dabble in anything and everything I can get my hands on. My top fields of interest are Computer Forensics, Data Science, Business Intelligence, and Programming. I currently take
        a Front End Development course while interning as a Data Analyst at the best company ever (Bridgevine). I am overly curious (at times to an extreme), but as the saying goes 'Curiosity will take you places'.</p>

      <h2 class="sectionHeader">My Roots</h2>
      <p class="sectionP">
        I was born in the small but proud country of Honduras, which if you don't know where it's located it's on a little strip of land that goes by the name of Central America that connects North and South America. Growing up in Honduras was great. My childhood
        was a mix of playing outside with mud and the neighborhood kids to enjoying every Sunday's at grandmas with the family. I was a curious child, always trying to know how things worked (breaking a few things in the process). Some things never change.
        Yet,it wasn't until recently that I discovered my passion for technology. I love the logic and structure that is involved in coding and manipulating data. Year Up played a big part in helping connect me with the big and ever expanding world of
        IT.

      <h2 class="sectionHeader">Goal</h2>
      <p class="sectionP"> My goal in life is to leave a legacy behind. I would be extremely disappointed if I left the world the same way I found it. I aspire to help everyone get access to an education. A smaller goal I have is to visit as many countries as possible. I
        would like to explore all the different cultures the world has to offer. My main goal right now is to finish Year Up and get hired at an amazing company. I am aiming to save up enough to go back to college. </p>

    <div class="sectionBox" id="s4">
      <h2 class="sectionHeader">Community Service</h2>
      <p class="sectionP"> One of my favorite things to do is to participate in community service events. During my Learning and Development phase at Year Up I ran for Comunity Service Activist and had the opportunity to go make the community a better place by motivating
        the student body to go out and support. </p>
