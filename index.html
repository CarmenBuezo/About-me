						<p class="sectionP">I am an enthusiastic, all-around, charismatic individual who likes to dabble in anything and everything I can get my hands on. My top fields of interest are Computer Forensics, Data Science, Business Intelligence and Programming. I currently take a Front End Development course while interning as a Data Analyst at the best company ever, Bridgevine. I am overly curious (at times to an extreme), but as the saying goes 'Curiosity will take you places'.</p>

					<p class="sectionP">
					 	I was born in the small but proud country Honduras, which if you don't know where it's located it's on a little strip of land called Central America that connects North and South America. As a child I was a curious one, always trying to know how things worked. Some things never change. By the age of 10 a came to the realization that I loved chicken wings (still do). It  wasn't until recently that I uncovered my my passion for technology. I found I loved the logic and structure that is involved in coding. Year Up played a big part in helping connect me with the big ever expanding world of IT.
